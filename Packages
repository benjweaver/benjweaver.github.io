Section: System
Description: Adds the command "execute" in terminal which enables substrate and launches LaunchDaemons that currently aren't launching automatically. This fixes tweaks such as Rocketbootstrap and Anemone. This is for iPhone 7 users on the mach_portal jailbreak. As of version 1.1, this should support other tweaks that usually would need a reinstall. It also no longer reinstalls packages through the script, and it enables them with the tweak’s LaunchDaemon. This version should enable compatibility with all tweaks that rely on /Library/LaunchDaemons/. This version also changes the command used from “fix” to “execute” because quite a few people requested for me not to use fix.
